# 1. Imperative vs Declarative

## Comparing the two approaches

A simple example to compare imperative vs Declarative is to imagine going to a destination in a taxi. With imperative commands, you would be giving individual directions (turn right, turn left, etc..). But with Declarative commands, you would instead be telling the taxi driver the location you would like to go to and the driver will take you there.

- Specifying what to do is the declarative approach
- Specifying how to do something is imperative approach
