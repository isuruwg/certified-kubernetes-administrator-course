# 1. Secrets
  - Take me to [Video Tutorials](https://kodekloud.com/topic/secrets-2/)

In this section, we will take a look at secrets in kubernetes

# 2. Web-Mysql Application

- One way is to move the app properties/envs into a configmap. But the configmap stores data into a plain text format. It is definitely not a right place to store a password.
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
   name: app-config
  data:
    DB_Host: mysql
    DB_User: root
    DB_Password: paswrd
  ```
  ![web1](../../images/web1.PNG)
  
- Secrets are used to store sensitive information. They are similar to configmaps but they are stored in an encrypted format or a hashed format.

# 3. There are 2 steps involved with secrets
- First, Create a secret
- Second, Inject the secret into a pod.
  
  ![sec](../../images/sec.PNG)
  
# 4. There are 2 ways of creating a secret
- The Imperative way
  ```
  $ kubectl create secret generic app-secret --from-literal=DB_Host=mysql --from-literal=DB_User=root --from-literal=DB_Password=paswrd
  $ kubectl create secret generic app-secret --from-file=app_secret.properties
  ```
  ![csi](../../images/csi.PNG)
  
- The Declarative way  
  When using the declarative method, you would need to **encode** the secret in base64 before putting it into the `.yaml` file. You can also use the `stringData` field instead.  This field allows you to put a non-base64 encoded string directly into the Secret, and the string will be encoded for you when the Secret is created or updated. [[REF](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configmap-secret/managing-secret-using-config-file/#create-the-config-file)]

  ```bash
  # Generate a hash value of the password and pass it to secret-data.yaml definition value as a value to DB_Password variable.
  $ echo -n "mysql" | base64
  $ echo -n "root" | base64
  $ echo -n "paswrd"| base64
  ```
  
  Create a secret definition file and run `kubectl create` to deploy it
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
   name: app-secret
  data:
    DB_Host: bX1zcWw=
    DB_User: cm9vdA==
    DB_Password: cGFzd3Jk
  ```
  ```bash
  $ kubectl create -f secret-data.yaml
  ```

## 4.1. Encode Secrets

  ![enc](../../images/enc.PNG)
  
## 4.2. View Secrets
- To view secrets
  ```
  $ kubectl get secrets
  ```
- To describe secret
  ```
  $ kubectl describe secret
  ```
- To view the values of the secret
  ```
  $ kubectl get secret app-secret -o yaml
  ```
  
  ![secv](../../images/secv.PNG)
  
## 4.3. Decode Secrets
- To decode secrets
  ```
  $ echo -n "bX1zcWw=" | base64 --decode
  $ echo -n "cm9vdA==" | base64 --decode
  $ echo -n "cGFzd3Jk" | base64 --decode
  ```
  ![secd](../../images/secd.PNG)
  
# 5. Configuring secret with a pod
- To inject a secret to a pod add a new property **`envFrom`** followed by **`secretRef`** name and then create the pod-definition
  
  ```
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
   name: app-secret
  data:
    DB_Host: bX1zcWw=
    DB_User: cm9vdA==
    DB_Password: cGFzd3Jk
  ```
  ```
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: simple-webapp-color
   spec:
    containers:
    - name: simple-webapp-color
      image: simple-webapp-color
      ports:
      - containerPort: 8080
      envFrom:
      - secretRef:
          name: app-secret
   ```
  ```
  $ kubectl create -f pod-definition.yaml
  ```
  ![secp](../../images/secp.PNG)
  
# 6. There are other ways to inject secrets into pods.
- You can inject as **`Single ENV variable`**
- You can inject as whole secret as files in a **`Volume`**

  ![seco](../../images/seco.PNG)
  
## 6.1. Secrets in pods as volume
- Each attribute in the secret is created as a file with the value of the secret as its content.

# 7. Additional Notes: [A Note on Secrets](https://kodekloud.com/topic/a-note-on-secrets/)

Remember that secrets encode data in base64 format. Anyone with the base64 encoded secret can easily decode it. As such the secrets can be considered as not very safe.

The concept of safety of the Secrets is a bit confusing in Kubernetes. The kubernetes documentation page and a lot of blogs out there refer to secrets as a "safer option" to store sensitive data. They are safer than storing in plain text as they reduce the risk of accidentally exposing passwords and other sensitive data. In my opinion it's not the secret itself that is safe, it is the practices around it. 

Secrets are not encrypted, so it is not safer in that sense. However, some best practices around using secrets make it safer. As in best practices like:

- Not checking-in secret object definition files to source code repositories.
- Enabling Encryption at Rest for Secrets so they are stored encrypted in ETCD. 



Also the way kubernetes handles secrets. Such as:

- A secret is only sent to a node if a pod on that node requires it.
- Kubelet stores the secret into a tmpfs so that the secret is not written to disk storage.
- Once the Pod that depends on the secret is deleted, kubelet will delete its local copy of the secret data as well.

Read about the [protections](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#protections) and [risks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks) of using secrets [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks)



Having said that, there are other better ways of handling sensitive data like passwords in Kubernetes, such as using tools like Helm Secrets, [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/).
