# Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/topic/taints-and-tolerations-vs-node-affinity/)

In this section, we will take a look at Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity

Let's say we have 3 pods, Blue Red and Green and want to schedule those pods on 3 specific nodes and we also don't want any other pods get scheduled on these dedicated nodes; 


- Taints and Tolerations do not guarantee that the pods will only prefer these nodes; in this case, the red pods may end up on one of the other nodes that do not have a taint or toleration set.

- As such, a combination of taints and tolerations and node affinity rules can be used together to completely dedicate nodes for specific parts. Using both taints and node affinity guarantees that our pods get scheduled on their dedicated nodes and no other pods get scheduled on these nodes.
